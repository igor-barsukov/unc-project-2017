The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted).

You don't need to add a special selector.\n *\n * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key\n * (ex: `#myForm=\"ngForm\"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying\n * {\\@link FormGroup} instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it\n * will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as\n * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.\n *\n * To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use {\\@link NgModel} with a\n * `name` attribute.  You can also use {\\@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create\n * sub-groups within the form.\n *\n * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has\n * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form\n * submission event.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport var NgForm = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgForm, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     */\n    function NgForm(validators, asyncValidators) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this._submitted = false;\n        this.ngSubmit = new EventEmitter();\n        this.form =\n            new FormGroup({}, composeValidators(validators), composeAsyncValidators(asyncValidators));\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForm.prototype, \"submitted\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._submitted;

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`).

You do\n * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.\n *\n * ### How to use select controls with form directives\n *\n * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`\n * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.\n *\n * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property\n * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (looseIdentical(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg.

Conversely,\n * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * Use this directive if you'd like to create and manage a {\\@link FormControl} instance directly.\n * Simply create a {\\@link FormControl}, save it to your component class, and pass it into the\n * {\\@link FormControlDirective}.\n *\n * This directive is designed to be used as a standalone control.  Unlike {\\@link FormControlName},\n * it does not require that your {\\@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent\n * {\\@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {\\@link FormGroupDirective} that\n * exists above it.\n *\n * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance. See a full list of available properties in\n * {\\@link AbstractControl}.\n *\n * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {\\@link FormControl},\n * or you can set it programmatically later using {\\@link AbstractControl.setValue} or\n * {\\@link AbstractControl.patchValue}.\n *\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\n * subscribe to the {\\@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to\n * {\\@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is\n * re-calculated.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleFormControl/simple_form_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport var FormControlDirective = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControlDirective, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function FormControlDirective(validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlDirective.prototype, \"isDisabled\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} isDisabled\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (isDisabled) { ReactiveErrors.disabledAttrWarning();

Conversely,\n * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * This directive is designed to be used with a parent {\\@link FormGroupDirective} (selector:\n * `[formGroup]`).\n *\n * It accepts the string name of the {\\@link FormControl} instance you want to\n * link, and will look for a {\\@link FormControl} registered with that name in the\n * closest {\\@link FormGroup} or {\\@link FormArray} above it.\n *\n * **Access the control**: You can access the {\\@link FormControl} associated with\n * this directive by using the {\\@link AbstractControl.get} method.\n * Ex: `this.form.get('first');`\n *\n * **Get value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the {\\@link FormControl}.\n * See a full list of available properties in {\\@link AbstractControl}.\n *\n *  **Set value**: You can set an initial value for the control when instantiating the\n *  {\\@link FormControl}, or you can set it programmatically later using\n *  {\\@link AbstractControl.setValue} or {\\@link AbstractControl.patchValue}.\n *\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\n * subscribe to the {\\@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to\n * {\\@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is\n * re-calculated.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * In this example, we create form controls for first name and last name.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleFormGroup/simple_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `formControlName` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: {\\@link ReactiveFormsModule}\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport var FormControlName = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControlName, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function FormControlName(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this._added = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"isDisabled\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} isDisabled\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (isDisabled) { ReactiveErrors.disabledAttrWarning(); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormControlName.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if (!this._added)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n            this.formDirective.updateModel(this, this.model);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormControlName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n        if (this.formDirective) {\n            this.formDirective.removeControl(this);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} newValue\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormControlName.prototype.viewToModelUpdate = function (newValue) {\n        this.viewModel = newValue;\n        this.update.emit(newValue);\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return controlPath(this.name, this._parent); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._parent ?
